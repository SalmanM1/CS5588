Phishing
Phishing is a form of social
engineering and a scam where
attackers deceive people into
revealing sensitive
information[1] or installing
malware such as viruses,
worms, adware, or ransomware.
Phishing attacks have become
increasingly sophisticated and
often transparently mirror the
site being targeted, allowing the
attacker to observe everything
while the victim navigates the
site, and transverses any
additional security boundaries
with the victim.[2] As of 2020,
it is the most common type of
cybercrime, with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's
Internet Crime Complaint
Center reporting more incidents
of phishing than any other type
of cybercrime.[3]
Modern phishing campaigns increasingly target multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems, not just
passwords. Attackers use spoofed login pages and real-time relay tools to capture both credentials and
one-time passcodes. In some cases, phishing kits are designed to bypass two-factor authentication by
immediately forwarding stolen credentials to the attacker's server, enabling instant access. A 2024 blog
post by Microsoft Entra highlighted the rise of adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attacks, which
intercept session tokens and allow attackers to authenticate as the victim.[4]
The term "phishing" was first recorded in 1995 in the cracking toolkit AOHell, but may have been used
earlier in the hacker magazine 2600.[5][6][7] It is a variation of fishing and refers to the use of lures to
"fish" for sensitive information.[6][8][9]
Measures to prevent or reduce the impact of phishing attacks include legislation, user education, public
awareness, and technical security measures.[10] The importance of phishing awareness has increased in
both personal and professional settings, with phishing attacks among businesses rising from 72% in 2017
to 86% in 2020,[11] already rising to 94% in 2023.[12]
Phishing techniques and vectors include email spam, vishing (voice phishing), targeted phishing (spear
phishing, whaling), smishing (SMS), quishing (QR code), cross-site scripting, and MiTM 2FA attacks.

Phishing attacks, often delivered via email spam, attempt to trick individuals into giving away sensitive
information or login credentials. Most attacks are "bulk attacks" that are not targeted and are instead sent
in bulk to a wide audience.[13] The goal of the attacker can vary, with common targets including financial
institutions, email and cloud productivity providers, and streaming services.[14] The stolen information or
access may be used to steal money, install malware, or spear phish others within the target
organization.[15] Compromised streaming service accounts may also be sold on darknet markets.[16]
This type of social engineering attack can involve sending fraudulent emails or messages that appear to
be from a trusted source, such as a bank or government agency. These messages typically redirect to a
fake login page where users are prompted to enter their credentials.
Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack that uses personalized messaging, especially e‑mails,[17] to
trick a specific individual or organization into believing they are legitimate. It often utilizes personal
information about the target to increase the chances of success.[18][19][20][21] These attacks often target
executives or those in financial departments with access to sensitive financial data and services.
Accountancy and audit firms are particularly vulnerable to spear phishing due to the value of the
information their employees have access to.[22]
The Russian government-run Threat Group-4127 (Fancy Bear; GRU Unit 26165) targeted Hillary
Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign with spear phishing attacks on over 1,800 Google accounts, using
the  accounts-google.com  domain to threaten targeted users.[23][24]
A study on spear phishing susceptibility among different age groups found that 43% of youth aged 18–
25 years and 58% of older users clicked on simulated phishing links in daily e‑mails over 21 days. Older
women had the highest susceptibility, while susceptibility in young users declined during the study, but
remained stable among older users.[25]
Voice over IP (VoIP) is used in vishing or voice phishing attacks,[26] where attackers make automated
phone calls to large numbers of people, often using text-to-speech synthesizers, claiming fraudulent
activity on their accounts. The attackers spoof the calling phone number to appear as if it is coming from
a legitimate bank or institution. The victim is then prompted to enter sensitive information or connected
to a live person who uses social engineering tactics to obtain information.[26] Vishing takes advantage of
the public's lower awareness and trust in voice telephony compared to email phishing.[27]
Types
Email phishing
Spear phishing
Voice phishing (Vishing)
SMS phishing (smishing)

A typical style of SMS phishing message
SMS phishing[28] or smishing[29][30] is a type of phishing
attack that uses text messages from a cell phone or
smartphone to deliver a bait message.[31] The victim is
usually asked to click a link, call a phone number, or contact
an email address provided by the attacker. They may then be
asked to provide private information, such as login credentials
for other websites.
The difficulty in identifying illegitimate links can be
compounded on mobile devices due to the limited display of
URLs in mobile browsers.[32]
Smishing can be just as effective as email phishing, as many
smartphones have fast internet connectivity. Smishing messages may also come from unusual phone
numbers.[33]
Page hijacking involves redirecting users to malicious websites or exploit kits through the compromise of
legitimate web pages, often using cross site scripting. Hackers may insert exploit kits such as MPack into
compromised websites to exploit legitimate users visiting the server. Page hijacking can also involve the
insertion of malicious inline frames, allowing exploit kits to load. This tactic is often used in conjunction
with watering hole attacks on corporate targets.[34]
In "quishing" (QR code phishing), scammers exploit the convenience of QR codes to trick users into
giving up sensitive data, by scanning a code containing an embedded malicious web site link. Unlike
traditional phishing, which relies on deceptive emails or websites, quishing uses QR codes to bypass
email filters[35][36] and increase the likelihood that victims will fall for the scam, as people tend to trust
QR codes and may not scrutinize them as carefully as a URL or email link. The bogus codes may be sent
by email, social media, or in some cases hard copy stickers are placed over legitimate QR codes on such
things as advertising posters and car park notices.[37][36] When victims scan the QR code with their phone
or device, they are redirected to a fake website designed to steal personal information, login credentials,
or financial details.[35]
As QR codes become more widely used for things like payments, event check-ins, and product
information, quishing is emerging as a significant concern for digital security. Users are advised to
exercise caution when scanning unfamiliar QR codes and ensure they are from trusted sources, although
the UK's National Cyber Security Centre rates the risk as lower than other types of lure.[38]
Traditional phishing attacks are typically limited to capturing user credentials directly inputted into
fraudulent websites. However, the advent of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) phishing techniques has
significantly advanced the sophistication of these attacks, enabling cybercriminals to bypass two-factor
authentication (2FA) mechanisms during a user's active session on a web service. MitM phishing attacks
employ intermediary tools that intercept communication between the user and the legitimate service.

QR code phishing (quishing)
Man-in-the-Middle phishing

Evilginx, originally created as an open-source tool for penetration testing and ethical hacking, has been
repurposed by cybercriminals for MitM attacks. Evilginx works like a middleman, passing information
between the victim and the real website without saving passwords or login codes. This makes it harder for
security systems to detect, since they usually look for phishing sites that store stolen data. By grabbing
login tokens and session cookies instantly, attackers can break into accounts and use them just like the
real user, for as long as the session stays active.
Attackers employ various methods, including phishing emails, social engineering tactics, or distributing
malicious links via social media platforms. Once the victim interacts with the counterfeit site, the MitM
tool intercepts the authentication process, effectively bypassing 2FA protections.[39]
Phishing attacks often involve creating fake links that appear to be from a legitimate organization.[40]
These links may use misspelled URLs or subdomains to deceive the user. In the following example URL,
http://www.yourbank.example.com/, it can appear to the untrained eye as though the URL
will take the user to the example section of the yourbank website; this URL points to the "yourbank" (i.e.
phishing subdomain) section of the example website (fraudster's domain name). Another tactic is to make
the displayed text for a link appear trustworthy, while the actual link goes to the phisher's site. To check
the destination of a link, many email clients and web browsers will show the URL in the status bar when
the mouse is hovering over it. However, some phishers may be able to bypass this security measure.[41]
Internationalized domain names (IDNs) can be exploited via IDN spoofing[42] or homograph attacks[43]
to allow attackers to create fake websites with visually identical addresses to legitimate ones. These
attacks have been used by phishers to disguise malicious URLs using open URL redirectors on trusted
websites.[44][45][46] An example of this is in http://www.exаmple.com/, where the third character
is not the Latin letter 'a', but instead the Cyrillic character 'а'. When the victim clicks on the link, unaware
that the third character is actually the Cyrillic letter 'а', they get redirected to the malicious site
http://www.xn--exmple-4nf.com/ Even digital certificates, such as SSL, may not protect
against these attacks as phishers can purchase valid certificates and alter content to mimic genuine
websites or host phishing sites without SSL.[47]
Phishing often uses social engineering techniques to trick users into performing actions such as clicking a
link or opening an attachment, or revealing sensitive information. It often involves pretending to be a
trusted entity and creating a sense of urgency,[48] like threatening to close or seize a victim's bank or
insurance account.[49]
An alternative technique to impersonation-based phishing is the use of fake news articles to trick victims
into clicking on a malicious link. These links often lead to fake websites that appear legitimate,[11] but are
actually run by attackers who may try to install malware or present fake "virus" notifications to the
victim.[50]

Early phishing techniques can be traced back to the 1990s,
when black hat hackers and the warez community used AOL
to steal credit card information and commit other online
crimes. The term "phishing" is said to have been coined by
Khan C. Smith, a well-known spammer and hacker,[51][a] and
its first recorded mention was found in the hacking tool AOHell, which was released in 1994. AOHell
allowed hackers to impersonate AOL staff and send instant messages to victims asking them to reveal
their passwords.[55][56] In response, AOL implemented measures to prevent phishing and eventually shut
down the warez scene on their platform.[57][58]
In the 2000s, phishing attacks became more organized and targeted. The first known direct attempt
against a payment system, E-gold, occurred in June 2001, and shortly after the September 11 attacks, a
"post-9/11 id check" phishing attack followed.[59] The first known phishing attack against a retail bank
was reported in September 2003.[60] Between May 2004 and May 2005, approximately 1.2 million
computer users in the United States suffered losses caused by phishing, totaling approximately
US$929 million.[61] Phishing was recognized as a fully organized part of the black market, and
specializations emerged on a global scale that provided phishing software for payment, which were
assembled and implemented into phishing campaigns by organized gangs.[62][63] The United Kingdom
banking sector suffered from phishing attacks, with losses from web banking fraud almost doubling in
2005 compared to 2004.[64][65] In 2006, almost half of phishing thefts were committed by groups
operating through the Russian Business Network based in St. Petersburg.[66] Email scams posing as the
Internal Revenue Service were also used to steal sensitive data from U.S. taxpayers.[67] Social
networking sites are a prime target of phishing, since the personal details in such sites can be used in
identity theft;[68] In 2007, 3.6 million adults lost US$3.2 billion due to phishing attacks.[69] The Anti-
Phishing Working Group reported receiving 115,370 phishing email reports from consumers with US and
China hosting more than 25% of the phishing pages each in the third quarter of 2009.[70]
Phishing in the 2010s saw a significant increase in the number of attacks. In 2011, the master keys for
RSA SecurID security tokens were stolen through a phishing attack.[71][72] Chinese phishing campaigns
also targeted high-ranking officials in the US and South Korean governments and military, as well as
Chinese political activists.[73][74] According to Ghosh, phishing attacks increased from 187,203 in 2010
to 445,004 in 2012. In August 2013, Outbrain suffered a spear-phishing attack,[75] and in November
2013, 110 million customer and credit card records were stolen from Target customers through a phished
subcontractor account.[76] CEO and IT security staff subsequently fired.[77] In August 2014, iCloud leaks
of celebrity photos were based on phishing e-mails sent to victims that looked like they came from Apple
or Google.[78] In November 2014, phishing attacks on ICANN gained administrative access to the
Centralized Zone Data System; also gained was data about users in the system - and access to ICANN's

linked to spear-phishing attacks against the Pentagon email system in August 2015,[80][81] and the group
used a zero-day exploit of Java in a spear-phishing attack on the White House and NATO.[82][83] Fancy
Bear carried out spear phishing attacks on email addresses associated with the Democratic National
Committee in the first quarter of 2016.[84][85] In August 2016, members of the Bundestag and political
parties such as Linken-faction leader Sahra Wagenknecht, Junge Union, and the CDU of Saarland were
targeted by spear-phishing attacks suspected to be carried out by Fancy Bear. In August 2016, the World
Anti-Doping Agency reported the receipt of phishing emails sent to users of its database claiming to be
official WADA, but consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear.[86][87][88] In 2017, 76% of
organizations experienced phishing attacks, with nearly half of the information security professionals
surveyed reporting an increase from 2016. In the first half of 2017, businesses and residents of Qatar
were hit with over 93,570 phishing events in a three-month span.[89] In August 2017, customers of
Amazon faced the Amazon Prime Day phishing attack, when hackers sent out seemingly legitimate deals
to customers of Amazon. When Amazon's customers attempted to make purchases using the "deals", the
transaction would not be completed, prompting the retailer's customers to input data that could be
compromised and stolen.[90] In 2018, the company block.one, which developed the EOS.IO blockchain,
was attacked by a phishing group who sent phishing emails to all customers aimed at intercepting the
user's cryptocurrency wallet key, and a later attack targeted airdrop tokens.[91]
Phishing attacks have evolved in the 2020s to include elements of social engineering, as demonstrated by
the July 15, 2020, Twitter breach. In this case, a 17-year-old hacker and accomplices set up a fake website
resembling Twitter's internal VPN provider used by remote working employees. Posing as helpdesk staff,
they called multiple Twitter employees, directing them to submit their credentials to the fake VPN
website.[92] Using the details supplied by the unsuspecting employees, they were able to seize control of
several high-profile user accounts, including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, and Apple
Inc.'s company account. The hackers then sent messages to Twitter followers soliciting Bitcoin,
promising to double the transaction value in return. The hackers collected 12.86 BTC (about $117,000 at
the time).[93] In the 2020s, phishing as a service (PhaaS) platforms like Darcula allow attackers to easily
fake trusted websites.[94]
There are anti-phishing websites which publish exact messages that have been recently circulating the
internet, such as FraudWatch International and Millersmiles. Such sites often provide specific details
about the particular messages.[95][96]
As recently as 2007, the adoption of anti-phishing strategies by businesses needing to protect personal
and financial information was low.[97] There are several different techniques to combat phishing,
including legislation and technology created specifically to protect against phishing. These techniques
include steps that can be taken by individuals, as well as by organizations. Phone, web site, and email
phishing can now be reported to authorities, as described below.

Federal Trade Commission intended to

Effective phishing education, including conceptual
knowledge[98] and feedback,[99][100] is an important part of
any organization's anti-phishing strategy. While there is
limited data on the effectiveness of education in reducing
susceptibility to phishing,[101] much information on the threat
is available online.[49]
Simulated phishing campaigns, in which organizations test
their employees' training by sending fake phishing emails, are
commonly used to assess their effectiveness. One example is
a study by the National Library of Medicine, in which an
organization received 858,200 emails during a 1-month
testing period, with 139,400 (16%) being marketing and
18,871 (2%) being identified as potential threats. These
campaigns are often used in the healthcare industry, as healthcare data is a valuable target for hackers.
These campaigns are just one of the ways that organizations are working to combat phishing.[102]
Nearly all legitimate e-mail messages from companies to their customers contain an item of information
that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example PayPal, always address their
customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion ("Dear
PayPal customer") it is likely to be an attempt at phishing.[103] Furthermore, PayPal offers various
methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their
spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. However it is unsafe to assume that
the presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate,[104] and some studies
have shown that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of
phishing attacks;[105] which suggests that most people do not pay attention to such details.
Emails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers, but research has
shown that people tend to not differentiate between the first and last digits.[106]
A study on phishing attacks in game environments found that educational games can effectively educate
players against information disclosures and can increase awareness on phishing risk thus mitigating
risks.[107]
The Anti-Phishing Working Group, one of the largest anti-phishing organizations in the world, produces
regular report on trends in phishing attacks.[108]
A wide range of technical approaches are available to prevent phishing attacks reaching users or to
prevent them from successfully capturing sensitive information.
Specialized spam filters can reduce the number of phishing emails that reach their addressees' inboxes.
These filters use a number of techniques including machine learning[109] and natural language processing
approaches to classify phishing emails,[110][111] and reject email with forged addresses.[112]

Technical approaches
Filtering out phishing mail

Another popular approach to fighting phishing is to maintain
a list of known phishing sites and to check websites against
the list. One such service is the Safe Browsing service.[113]
Web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer 7,
Mozilla Firefox 2.0, Safari 3.2, and Opera all contain this
type of anti-phishing measure.[114][115][116][117][118] Firefox 2
used Google anti-phishing software. Opera 9.1 uses live
blacklists from Phishtank, cyscon and GeoTrust, as well as
live whitelists from GeoTrust. Some implementations of this
approach send the visited URLs to a central service to be
checked, which has raised concerns about privacy.[119]
According to a report by Mozilla in late 2006, Firefox 2 was
found to be more effective than Internet Explorer 7 at
detecting fraudulent sites in a study by an independent
software testing company.[120]
An approach introduced in mid-2006 involves switching to a special DNS service that filters out known
phishing domains.[121]
To mitigate the problem of phishing sites impersonating a victim site by embedding its images (such as
logos), several site owners have altered the images to send a message to the visitor that a site may be
fraudulent. The image may be moved to a new filename and the original permanently replaced, or a
server can detect that the image was not requested as part of normal browsing, and instead send a warning
image.[122][123]
The Bank of America website[124][125] was one of several that asked users to select a personal image
(marketed as SiteKey) and displayed this user-selected image with any forms that request a password.
Users of the bank's online services were instructed to enter a password only when they saw the image
they selected. The bank has since discontinued the use of SiteKey. Several studies suggest that few users
refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent.[126][127] In addition, this feature (like other
forms of two-factor authentication) is susceptible to other attacks, such as those suffered by Scandinavian
bank Nordea in late 2005,[128] and Citibank in 2006.[129]
A similar system, in which an automatically generated "Identity Cue" consisting of a colored word within
a colored box is displayed to each website user, is in use at other financial institutions.[130]
Security skins[131][132] are a related technique that involves overlaying a user-selected image onto the
login form as a visual cue that the form is legitimate. Unlike the website-based image schemes, however,
the image itself is shared only between the user and the browser, and not between the user and the
website. The scheme also relies on a mutual authentication protocol, which makes it less vulnerable to
attacks that affect user-only authentication schemes.
Still another technique relies on a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The
user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only
after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their

alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America
website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login,
requires active participation from the user, and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly
replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the
user's secret categories.[133]
Several companies offer banks and other organizations likely to suffer from phishing scams round-the-
clock services to monitor, analyze and assist in shutting down phishing websites.[134] Automated
detection of phishing content is still below accepted levels for direct action, with content-based analysis
reaching between 80% and 90% of success[135] so most of the tools include manual steps to certify the
detection and authorize the response.[136] Individuals can contribute by reporting phishing to both
volunteer and industry groups,[137] such as cyscon or PhishTank.[138] Phishing web pages and emails can
be reported to Google.[139][140]
Organizations can implement two factor or multi-factor authentication (MFA), which requires a user to
use at least 2 factors when logging in. (For example, a user must both present a smart card and a
password). This mitigates some risk, in the event of a successful phishing attack, the stolen password on
its own cannot be reused to further breach the protected system. However, there are several attack
methods which can defeat many of the typical systems.[141] MFA schemes such as WebAuthn address this
issue by design.
On January 26, 2004, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
filed the first phising lawsuit, against a Californian teenager
suspected of creating a webpage mimicking America Online
and stealing credit card information.[142] Other countries have
followed this lead by tracing and arresting phishers. A
phishing kingpin, Valdir Paulo de Almeida, was arrested in
Brazil for leading one of the largest phishing crime rings,
which in two years stole between US$18 million and
US$37 million.[143] UK authorities jailed two men in June
2005 for their role in a phishing scam,[144] in a case connected
to the U.S. Secret Service Operation Firewall, which targeted
notorious "carder" websites.[145] In 2006, Japanese police
arrested eight people for creating fake Yahoo Japan websites, netting themselves ¥100 million
(US$870,000)[146] and the FBI detained a gang of sixteen in the U.S. and Europe in Operation
Cardkeeper.[147]
Senator Patrick Leahy introduced the Anti-Phishing Act of 2005 to Congress in the United States on
March 1, 2005. This bill aimed to impose fines of up to $250,000 and prison sentences of up to five years
on criminals who used fake websites and emails to defraud consumers.[148] In the UK, the Fraud Act

2006[149] introduced a general offense of fraud punishable by up to ten years in prison and prohibited the
development or possession of phishing kits with the intention of committing fraud.[150]
Companies have also joined the effort to crack down on phishing. On March 31, 2005, Microsoft filed
117 federal lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The lawsuits
accuse "John Doe" defendants of obtaining passwords and confidential information. March 2005 also saw
a partnership between Microsoft and the Australian government teaching law enforcement officials how
to combat various cyber crimes, including phishing.[151] Microsoft announced a planned further 100
lawsuits outside the U.S. in March 2006,[152] followed by the commencement, as of November 2006, of
129 lawsuits mixing criminal and civil actions.[153] AOL reinforced its efforts against phishing[154] in
early 2006 with three lawsuits[155] seeking a total of US$18 million under the 2005 amendments to the
Virginia Computer Crimes Act,[156][157] and Earthlink has joined in by helping to identify six men
subsequently charged with phishing fraud in Connecticut.[158]
In January 2007, Jeffrey Brett Goodin of California became the first defendant convicted by a jury under
the provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. He was found guilty of sending thousands of emails to
AOL users, while posing as the company's billing department, which prompted customers to submit
personal and credit card information. Facing a possible 101 years in prison for the CAN-SPAM violation
and ten other counts including wire fraud, the unauthorized use of credit cards, and the misuse of AOL's
trademark, he was sentenced to serve 70 months. Goodin had been in custody since failing to appear for
an earlier court hearing and began serving his prison term immediately.[159][160][161][162]
