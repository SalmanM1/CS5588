This reranking step uses a cross-encoder to re-score the top retrieved chunks by looking at the query + chunk text together, which is more precise than raw BM25/embedding similarity. It helps prevent a common failure where hybrid retrieval returns “topic-related” chunks that don’t actually answer the user’s question (e.g., generic security context instead of breach-response actions). By pushing the most directly relevant evidence to the top, reranking reduces hallucination risk and improves trust because the final answer is based on stronger citations."

It also behaved correctly on U3 by abstaining (“Not enough evidence”) when the dataset didn’t contain state-specific breach notification deadlines, reducing compliance risk. The system struggled on U2 (high-stakes breach response) in the generation/citation formatting layer—the model sometimes outputs chunk labels like “[Chunk 1] …” instead of consistently producing clean bullet points with citations, even when retrieval is strong. This shows that retrieval and reranking are working, but the answer-generation prompt/governance format still needs tightening for consistent, user-friendly outputs in high-stakes cases."

I then compute Precision@5 as “how many of the top 5 chunks were actually useful evidence,” and Recall@10 as “how many of the needed evidence chunks showed up in the top 10,” based on an estimated total number of relevant chunks for each query. I also assign product scores: trust means the system gives evidence-backed, non-misleading guidance with citations and abstains when needed (especially important for SecOps users). For my target users (incident responders), trust is about auditability and safety—if the system can’t support an answer from the dataset, it should say “Not enough evidence” rather than guessing.\n"
