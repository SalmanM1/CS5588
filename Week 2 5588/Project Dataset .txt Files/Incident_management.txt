Incident management
An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or
functions. Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify,
analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. These incidents within a structured
organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team (IRT), an incident management
team (IMT), or Incident Command System (ICS). Without effective incident management, an incident
can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital
business functions.[1]
An incident is an event that could lead to the loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations,
services or functions.[2] Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization
to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. If not managed, an incident can
escalate into an emergency, crisis or disaster. Incident management is therefore the process of limiting the
potential disruption caused by such an event, followed by a return to business as usual. Without effective
incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems,
employees, customers, or other vital business functions.[1]
National Fire Protection Association states that incident management can be described as, '[a]n IMS
[incident management system] is "the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures and
communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the management
of resources during incidents".[3][4]
Physical incident management is the real-time response that may last for hours, days, or longer. The
United Kingdom Cabinet Office has produced the National Recovery Guidance (NRG), which is aimed at
local responders as part of the implementation of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (CCA). It describes
the response as the following: "Response encompasses the actions taken to deal with the immediate
effects of an emergency. In many scenarios, it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of
hours or days – rapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration, coordination and communication
is, therefore, vital. Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the
emergency itself (eg fighting fires, rescuing individuals) but also the indirect effects (eg disruption, media
interest)".[5][6]
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is the world's largest developer of
international standards also makes a point in the description of its risk management, principles and
guidelines document ISO 31000:2009 that, "Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the
likelihood of achieving objectives, improve the identification of opportunities and threats and effectively
allocate and use resources for risk treatment".[7] This again shows the importance of not just good
planning but the effective allocation of resources to treat the risk.
Description
Physical incident management

Today, an important role is played by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), due to the
rise of internet crime, and is a common example of an incident faced by companies in developed nations
all across the world. For example, if an organization discovers that an intruder has gained unauthorized
access to a computer system, the CSIRT would analyze the situation, determine the breadth of the
compromise, and take corrective action.
Currently, over half of the world's hacking attempts on Trans National Corporations (TNCs) take place in
North America (57%). 23% of attempts take place in Europe.[8] Having a well-rounded Computer
Security Incident Response team is integral to providing a secure environment for any organization, and
is becoming a critical part of the overall design of many modern networking teams.
Incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team
(IRT), or an incident management team (IMT). These are often designated beforehand or during the event
and are placed in control of the organization whilst the incident is dealt with, to restore normal functions.
The incident commander manages the response to a security incident and leads the members of the
incident response team(s) through the process, as defined by the Incident Command System (ICS).[9]
Usually, as part of the wider management process in private organizations, incident management is
followed by post-incident analysis where it is determined why the incident happened despite precautions
and controls. This analysis is normally overseen by the leaders of the organization, with the view of
preventing a repetition of the incident through precautionary measures and often changes in policy. This
information is then used as feedback to further develop the security policy and/or its practical
implementation. In the United States, the National Incident Management System, developed by the
Department of Homeland Security, integrates effective practices in emergency management into a
comprehensive national framework. This often results in a higher level of contingency planning, exercise
and training, as well as an evaluation of the management of the incident.[10]
During the root cause analysis, human factors should be assessed. James Reason conducted a study into
the understanding of adverse effects of human factors.[11] The study found that major incident
investigations, such as Piper Alpha and Kings Cross Underground Fire, made it clear that the causes of
the accidents were distributed widely within and outside the organization. There are two types of events:
active failure—an action that has immediate effects and has the likelihood to cause an accident—and
latent or delayed action—events can take years to have an effect and are usually combined with triggering
events that then cause the accident.

Human factors

Latent failures are created as the result of decisions taken at the higher echelons of an organisation. Their
damaging consequences may lie dormant for a long time, only becoming evident when they combine with
local triggering factors (e.g., the spring tide, the loading difficulties at Zeebrugge harbour, etc.) to breach
the system's defences. Decisions taken in the higher echelons of an organization can trigger the events
towards an accident becoming more likely, the planning, scheduling, forecasting, designing,
policymaking, etc., can have a slow burning effect. The actual unsafe act that triggers an accident can be
traced back through the organization and the subsequent failures can be exposed, showing the
accumulation of latent failures within the system as a whole that led to the accident becoming more likely
and ultimately happening. Better improvement action can be applied, and reduce the likelihood of the
event happening again.[12]
Incident management is an important part of IT service management (ITSM) process area.[13] The first
goal of the incident management process is to restore a normal service operation as quickly as possible
and to minimize the impact on business operations, thus ensuring that the best possible levels of service
quality and availability are maintained. 'Normal service operation' is defined here as service operation
within service-level agreement (SLA). It is one process area within the broader ITIL and ISO 20000
environment.
ISO 20000 defines the objective of Incident management (part 1, 8.2) as: To restore agreed service to the
business as soon as possible or to respond to service requests.[14]
ITIL 2011 defines an incident as:
an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service or a
failure of a Configuration Item that has not yet impacted an IT service (for example failure
of one disk from a mirror set).[15]

possible and the business impact is minimized. ITIL Service Operation. AXELOS. 30 May 2007.

The main challenges and cause for problems in the Incident management are:
1. Constantly increasing Alert and Event Noise
2. Complex and Lengthy IT Problem Resolution Process
3. Inability to effectively predict and prevent IT service degradations or outages[16]
