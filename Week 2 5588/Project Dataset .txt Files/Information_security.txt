Information security
Information security (infosec) is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks.
It is part of information risk management.[1] It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability
of unauthorized or inappropriate access to data or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion,
corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information. It also involves actions
intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. Protected information may take any form, e.g.,
electronic or physical, tangible (e.g., paperwork), or intangible (e.g., knowledge).[2][3] Information
security's primary focus is the balanced protection of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability
(known as the CIA triad, unrelated to the US government organization)[4] while maintaining a focus on
efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.[5] This is largely
achieved through a structured risk management process.[6]
To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate to offer guidance, policies, and
industry standards on passwords, antivirus software, firewalls, encryption software, legal liability,
security awareness and training, and so forth.[7] This standardization may be further driven by a wide
variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed, processed, stored, transferred, and
destroyed.[8]
While paper-based business operations are still prevalent, requiring their own set of information security
practices, enterprise digital initiatives are increasingly being emphasized,[9][10] with information
assurance now typically being dealt with by information technology (IT) security specialists. These
specialists apply information security to technology (most often some form of computer system).
IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature
and value of the data within larger businesses.[11] They are responsible for keeping all of the technology
within the company secure from malicious attacks that often attempt to acquire critical private
information or gain control of the internal systems.[12][13]
There are many specialist roles in Information Security including securing networks and allied
infrastructure, securing applications and databases, security testing, information systems auditing,
business continuity planning, electronic record discovery, and digital forensics.[14]
Information security standards are techniques generally outlined in published materials that attempt to
protect the information of a user or organization.[15] This environment includes users themselves,
networks, devices, all software, processes, information in storage or transit, applications, services, and
systems that can be connected directly or indirectly to networks.
The principal objective is to reduce the risks, including preventing or mitigating attacks. These published
materials consist of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management
approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies.
Definitions

Information Security Attributes: or
qualities, i.e., Confidentiality, Integrity and
Availability (CIA). Information Systems
are composed in three main portions,
hardware, software and communications
with the purpose to help identify and
apply information security industry
standards, as mechanisms of protection
and prevention, at three levels or layers:
physical, personal and organizational.
Essentially, procedures or policies are
implemented to tell administrators, users
and operators how to use products to
ensure information security within the
organizations.[16]
Various definitions of information security are suggested
below, summarized from different sources:
1. "Preservation of confidentiality, integrity and
availability of information. Note: In addition, other
properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-
repudiation and reliability can also be involved."
(ISO/IEC 27000:2018)[17]
2. "The protection of information and information
systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
disruption, modification, or destruction in order to
provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
(CNSS, 2010)[18]
3. "Ensures that only authorized users (confidentiality)
have access to accurate and complete information
(integrity) when required (availability)." (ISACA,
2008)[19]
4. "Information Security is the process of protecting the
intellectual property of an organisation." (Pipkin,
2000)[20]
5. "...information security is a risk management
discipline, whose job is to manage the cost of
information risk to the business." (McDermott and
Geer, 2001)[21]
6. "A well-informed sense of assurance that information
risks and controls are in balance." (Anderson, J.,
2003)[22]
7. "Information security is the protection of information
and minimizes the risk of exposing information to
unauthorized parties." (Venter and Eloff, 2003)[23]
8. "Information Security is a multidisciplinary area of study and professional activity which is
concerned with the development and implementation of security mechanisms of all available
types (technical, organizational, human-oriented and legal) in order to keep information in all
its locations (within and outside the organization's perimeter) and, consequently, information
systems, where information is created, processed, stored, transmitted and destroyed, free
from threats.[24]
9. Information and information resource security using telecommunication system or devices
means protecting information, information systems or books from unauthorized access,
damage, theft, or destruction (Kurose and Ross, 2010).[25]
Information security threats come in many different forms.[26] Some of the most common threats today
are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, theft of identity, theft of equipment or information,
sabotage, and information extortion.[27][28] Viruses,[29] worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a
few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive
issue for many businesses.[30] Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that
person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information through social
engineering.[31][32] Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization's website in an attempt
to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers.[33] Information extortion consists of theft of a

company's property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the
information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware.[34] One of the most functional precautions
against these attacks is to conduct periodical user awareness.[35]
Governments, military, corporations, financial institutions, hospitals, non-profit organizations, and private
businesses amass a great deal of confidential information about their employees, customers, products,
research, and financial status.[36] Should confidential information about a business's customers or
finances or new product line fall into the hands of a competitor or hacker, a business and its customers
could suffer widespread, irreparable financial loss, as well as damage to the company's reputation.[37]
From a business perspective, information security must be balanced against cost; the Gordon-Loeb Model
provides a mathematical economic approach for addressing this concern.[38]
For the individual, information security has a significant effect on privacy, which is viewed very
differently in various cultures.[39]
Since the early days of communication, diplomats and military commanders understood that it was
necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some
means of detecting tampering.[40] Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50
B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall
into the wrong hands.[41] However, for the most part protection was achieved through the application of
procedural handling controls.[42][43] Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be
protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong
box.[44] As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher,
read, and reseal letters (e.g., the U.K.'s Secret Office, founded in 1653[45]).
In the mid-nineteenth century more complex classification systems were developed to allow governments
to manage their information according to the degree of sensitivity.[46] For example, the British
Government codified this, to some extent, with the publication of the Official Secrets Act in 1889.[47]
Section 1 of the law concerned espionage and unlawful disclosures of information, while Section 2 dealt
with breaches of official trust.[48] A public interest defense was soon added to defend disclosures in the
interest of the state.[49] A similar law was passed in India in 1889, The Indian Official Secrets Act, which
was associated with the British colonial era and used to crack down on newspapers that opposed the Raj's
policies.[50] A newer version was passed in 1923 that extended to all matters of confidential or secret
information for governance.[51] By the time of the First World War, multi-tier classification systems were
used to communicate information to and from various fronts, which encouraged greater use of code
making and breaking sections in diplomatic and military headquarters.[52] Encoding became more
sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and unscramble information.[53]
The establishment of computer security inaugurated the history of information security. The need for such
appeared during World War II.[54] The volume of information shared by the Allied countries during the
Second World War necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls.[55]
An arcane range of markings evolved to indicate who could handle documents (usually officers rather
than enlisted troops) and where they should be stored as increasingly complex safes and storage facilities
were developed.[56] The Enigma Machine, which was employed by the Germans to encrypt the data of

warfare and was successfully decrypted by Alan Turing, can be regarded as a striking example of creating
and using secured information.[57] Procedures evolved to ensure documents were destroyed properly, and
it was the failure to follow these procedures which led to some of the greatest intelligence coups of the
war (e.g., the capture of U-570[57]).
Various mainframe computers were connected online during the Cold War to complete more sophisticated
tasks, in a communication process easier than mailing magnetic tapes back and forth by computer centers.
As such, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), of the United States Department of Defense,
started researching the feasibility of a networked system of communication to trade information within
the United States Armed Forces. In 1968, the ARPANET project was formulated by Larry Roberts, which
would later evolve into what is known as the internet.[58]
In 1973, important elements of ARPANET security were found by internet pioneer Robert Metcalfe to
have many flaws such as the: "vulnerability of password structure and formats; lack of safety procedures
for dial-up connections; and nonexistent user identification and authorizations", aside from the lack of
controls and safeguards to keep data safe from unauthorized access. Hackers had effortless access to
ARPANET, as phone numbers were known by the public.[59] Due to these problems, coupled with the
constant violation of computer security, as well as the exponential increase in the number of hosts and
users of the system, "network security" was often alluded to as "network insecurity".[59]
The end of the twentieth century and the early years of the
twenty-first century saw rapid advancements in
telecommunications, computing hardware and software, and
data encryption.[60] The availability of smaller, more
powerful, and less expensive computing equipment made
electronic data processing within the reach of small business
and home users.[61] The establishment of Transfer Control
Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) in the early 1980s
enabled different types of computers to communicate.[62]
These computers quickly became interconnected through the
internet.[63]
The rapid growth and widespread use of electronic data
processing and electronic business conducted through the
internet, along with numerous occurrences of international
terrorism, fueled the need for better methods of protecting the
computers and the information they store, process, and
transmit.[64] The academic disciplines of computer security
and information assurance emerged along with numerous
professional organizations, all sharing the common goals of
ensuring the security and reliability of information
systems.[65]

The "CIA triad" of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security.[66]
The concept was introduced in the Anderson Report in 1972 and later repeated in The Protection of
Information in Computer Systems. The abbreviation was coined by Steve Lipner around 1986.[67]
Debate continues about whether or not this triad is sufficient to address rapidly changing technology and
business requirements, with recommendations to consider expanding on the intersections between
availability and confidentiality, as well as the relationship between security and privacy.[4] Other
principles such as "accountability" have sometimes been proposed; it has been pointed out that issues
such as non-repudiation do not fit well within the three core concepts.[68]
In information security, confidentiality "is the property, that information is not made available or
disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes."[69] While similar to "privacy", the two
words are not interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to
protect our data from unauthorized viewers.[70] Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being
compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect
individuals.[71]
In IT security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over
its entire lifecycle.[72] This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected
manner.[73] This is not the same thing as referential integrity in databases, although it can be viewed as a
special case of consistency as understood in the classic ACID model of transaction processing.[74]
Information security systems typically incorporate controls to ensure their own integrity, in particular
protecting the kernel or core functions against both deliberate and accidental threats.[75] Multi-purpose
and multi-user computer systems aim to compartmentalize the data and processing such that no user or
process can adversely impact another: the controls may not succeed however, as we see in incidents such
as malware infections, hacks, data theft, fraud, and privacy breaches.[76]
More broadly, integrity is an information security principle that involves human/social, process, and
commercial integrity, as well as data integrity. As such it touches on aspects such as credibility,
consistency, truthfulness, completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and assurance.[77]
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed.[78]
This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to
protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.[79] High
availability systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power

outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades.[80] Ensuring availability also involves preventing
denial-of-service attacks, such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it
to shut down.[81]
In the realm of information security, availability can often be viewed as one of the most important parts
of a successful information security program. Ultimately end-users need to be able to perform job
functions; by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an
organization's stakeholders expect.[82] This can involve topics such as proxy configurations, outside web
access, the ability to access shared drives and the ability to send emails.[83] Executives oftentimes do not
understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix, but this often
requires collaboration from many different organizational teams, such as network operations,
development operations, incident response, and policy/change management.[84] A successful information
security team involves many different key roles to mesh and align for the "CIA" triad to be provided
effectively.[85]
In addition to the classic CIA triad of security goals, some organisations may want to include security
goals like authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation, and reliability.
In law, non-repudiation implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also implies that
one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having
sent a transaction.[86]
It is important to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation
efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology.[87] It is not, for
instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private
key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message, and nobody else could have altered it in transit
(data integrity).[88] The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is
vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised.[89] The fault for
these violations may or may not lie with the sender, and such assertions may or may not relieve the
sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves
authenticity and integrity. As such, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and
integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).[90]
In 1992 and revised in 2002, the OECD's Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and
Networks[91] proposed the nine generally accepted principles: awareness, responsibility, response, ethics,
democracy, risk assessment, security design and implementation, security management, and
reassessment.[92] Building upon those, in 2004 the NIST's Engineering Principles for Information
Technology Security[68] proposed 33 principles.
In 1998, Donn Parker proposed an alternative model for the classic "CIA" triad that he called the six
atomic elements of information. The elements are confidentiality, possession, integrity, authenticity,
availability, and utility. The merits of the Parkerian Hexad are a subject of debate amongst security

professionals.[93]
In 2011, The Open Group published the information security management standard O-ISM3.[94] This
standard proposed an operational definition of the key concepts of security, with elements called "security
objectives", related to access control (9), availability (3), data quality (1), compliance, and technical (4).
Risk is the likelihood that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset (or the
loss of the asset).[95] A vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to endanger or cause harm to an
informational asset. A threat is anything (man-made or act of nature) that has the potential to cause
harm.[96] The likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a threat
does use a vulnerability to inflict harm, it has an impact.[97] In the context of information security, the
impact is a loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and possibly other losses (lost income, loss
of life, loss of real property).[98]
The Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) Review Manual 2006 defines risk management as
"the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the information resources used by an organization
in achieving business objectives, and deciding what countermeasures,[99] if any, to take in reducing risk
to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization."[100]
There are two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the process of risk
management is an ongoing, iterative process. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment
is constantly changing and new threats and vulnerabilities emerge every day.[101] Second, the choice of
countermeasures (controls) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost,
effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected.[102]
Furthermore, these processes have limitations as security breaches are generally rare and emerge in a
specific context which may not be easily duplicated.[103] Thus, any process and countermeasure should
itself be evaluated for vulnerabilities.[104] It is not possible to identify all risks, nor is it possible to
eliminate all risk. The remaining risk is called "residual risk".[105]
A risk assessment is carried out by a team of people who have knowledge of specific areas of the
business.[106] Membership of the team may vary over time as different parts of the business are
assessed.[107] The assessment may use a subjective qualitative analysis based on informed opinion, or
where reliable dollar figures and historical information is available, the analysis may use quantitative
analysis.
Research has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user,
operator, designer, or other human.[108] The ISO/IEC 27002:2005 Code of practice for information
security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:
security policy,
organization of information security,
asset management,
human resources security,
physical and environmental security,
communications and operations management,
Risk management

access control,
information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance,
information security incident management,
business continuity management
regulatory compliance.
In broad terms, the risk management process consists of:[109][110]
1. Identification of assets and estimating their value. Include: people, buildings, hardware,
software, data (electronic, print, other), supplies.[111]
2. Conduct a threat assessment. Include: Acts of nature, acts of war, accidents, malicious acts
originating from inside or outside the organization.[112]
3. Conduct a vulnerability assessment, and for each vulnerability, calculate the probability that
it will be exploited. Evaluate policies, procedures, standards, training, physical security,
quality control, technical security.[113]
4. Calculate the impact that each threat would have on each asset. Use qualitative analysis or
quantitative analysis.[114]
5. Identify, select and implement appropriate controls. Provide a proportional response.
Consider productivity, cost effectiveness, and value of the asset.[115]
6. Evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. Ensure the controls provide the required
cost effective protection without discernible loss of productivity.[116]
For any given risk, management can choose to accept the risk based upon the relative low value of the
asset, the relative low frequency of occurrence, and the relative low impact on the business.[117] Or,
leadership may choose to mitigate the risk by selecting and implementing appropriate control measures to
reduce the risk. In some cases, the risk can be transferred to another business by buying insurance or
outsourcing to another business.[118] The reality of some risks may be disputed. In such cases leadership
may choose to deny the risk.[119]
Selecting and implementing proper security controls will initially help an organization bring down risk to
acceptable levels.[120] Control selection should follow and should be based on the risk assessment.[121]
Controls can vary in nature, but fundamentally they are ways of protecting the confidentiality, integrity or
availability of information. ISO/IEC 27001 has defined controls in different areas.[122] Organizations can
implement additional controls according to requirement of the organization.[123] ISO/IEC 27002 offers a
guideline for organizational information security standards.[124]
Defense in depth is a fundamental security philosophy that relies on overlapping security systems
designed to maintain protection even if individual components fail. Rather than depending on a single
security measure, it combines multiple layers of security controls both in the cloud and at network
endpoints. This approach includes combinations like firewalls with intrusion-detection systems, email
filtering services with desktop anti-virus, and cloud-based security alongside traditional network
defenses.[125] The concept can be implemented through three distinct layers of administrative, logical,
and physical controls,[126] or visualized as an onion model with data at the core, surrounded by people,
Security controls

The onion model of defense in depth
network security, host-based security, and application security
layers.[127] The strategy emphasizes that security involves not
just technology, but also people and processes working
together, with real-time monitoring and response being
crucial components.[125]
An important aspect of information security and risk
management is recognizing the value of information and
defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements
for the information.[128] Not all information is equal and so
not all information requires the same degree of
protection.[129] This requires information to be assigned a
security classification.[130] The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior
management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. Next, develop a classification
policy.[131] The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for
information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required security controls for each
classification.[132]
Some factors that influence which classification information should be assigned include how much value
that information has to the organization, how old the information is and whether or not the information
has become obsolete.[133] Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when
classifying information.[134] The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and its
Business Model for Information Security also serves as a tool for security professionals to examine
security from a systems perspective, creating an environment where security can be managed holistically,
allowing actual risks to be addressed.[135]
The type of information security classification labels selected and used will depend on the nature of the
organization, with examples being:[132]
In the business sector, labels such as: Public, Sensitive, Private, Confidential.
In the government sector, labels such as: Unclassified, Unofficial, Protected, Confidential,
Secret, Top Secret, and their non-English equivalents.[136]
In cross-sectoral formations, the Traffic Light Protocol, which consists of: White, Green,
Amber, and Red.
In the personal sector, one label such as Financial. This includes activities related to
managing money, such as online banking.[137]
All employees in the organization, as well as business partners, must be trained on the classification
schema and understand the required security controls and handling procedures for each classification.[138]
The classification of a particular information asset that has been assigned should be reviewed periodically
to ensure the classification is still appropriate for the information and to ensure the security controls
required by the classification are in place and are followed in their right procedures.[139]
Classification

Access to protected information must be restricted to people who are authorized to access the
information.[140] The computer programs, and in many cases the computers that process the information,
must also be authorized.[141] This requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected
information.[141] The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value
of the information being protected; the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control
mechanisms need to be.[142] The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with
identification and authentication.[143]
Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, authentication, and
authorization.[144][71]
Identification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement
"Hello, my name is John Doe" they are making a claim of who they are.[145] However, their claim may or
may not be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to
verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe.[146] Typically the claim is in the form
of a username. By entering that username you are claiming "I am the person the username belongs
to".[147]
Authentication is the act of verifying a claim of identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a
withdrawal, he tells the bank teller he is John Doe, a claim of identity.[148] The bank teller asks to see a
photo ID, so he hands the teller his driver's license.[149] The bank teller checks the license to make sure it
has John Doe printed on it and compares the photograph on the license against the person claiming to be
John Doe.[150] If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is
who he claimed to be. Similarly, by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that
he/she is the person the username belongs to.[151]
There are three different types of information that can be used for authentication:[152][153]
Something you know: things such as a PIN, a password, or your mother's maiden
name[154][155]
Something you have: a driver's license or a magnetic swipe card[156][157]
Something you are: biometrics, including palm prints, fingerprints, voice prints, and retina
(eye) scans[158]
Strong authentication requires providing more than one type of authentication information (two-factor
authentication).[159] The username is the most common form of identification on computer systems today
and the password is the most common form of authentication.[160] Usernames and passwords have served
their purpose, but they are increasingly inadequate.[161] Usernames and passwords are slowly being
replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as time-based one-
time password algorithms.[162]
Access control
Identification
Authentication

After a person, program or computer has successfully been identified and authenticated then it must be
determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they will be
allowed to perform (run, view, create, delete, or change).[163] This is called authorization. Authorization
to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and
procedures.[164] The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by
whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these
policies.[165] Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control
mechanisms. Some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms.[166] The access
control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control, or it
may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.[71]
The non-discretionary approach consolidates all access control under a centralized administration.[167]
The access to information and other resources is usually based on the individuals function (role) in the
organization or the tasks the individual must perform.[168][169] The discretionary approach gives the
creator or owner of the information resource the ability to control access to those resources.[167] In the
mandatory access control approach, access is granted or denied basing upon the security classification
assigned to the information resource.[140]
Examples of common access control mechanisms in use today include role-based access control,
available in many advanced database management systems; simple file permissions provided in the
UNIX and Windows operating systems;[170] Group Policy Objects provided in Windows network
systems; and Kerberos, RADIUS, TACACS, and the simple access lists used in many firewalls and
routers.[171]
To be effective, policies and other security controls must be enforceable and upheld. Effective policies
ensure that people are held accountable for their actions.[172] The U.S. Treasury's guidelines for systems
processing sensitive or proprietary information, for example, states that all failed and successful
authentication and access attempts must be logged, and all access to information must leave some type of
audit trail.[173]
Also, the need-to-know principle needs to be in effect when talking about access control. This principle
gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions.[174] This principle is used in the
government when dealing with difference clearances.[175] Even though two employees in different
departments have a top-secret clearance, they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be
exchanged. Within the need-to-know principle, network administrators grant the employee the least
amount of privilege to prevent employees from accessing more than what they are supposed to.[176]
Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad. Need-to-know directly
impacts the confidential area of the triad.[177]
Information security uses cryptography to transform usable information into a form that renders it
unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called encryption.[178] Information that
has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be transformed back into its original usable form by an
authorized user who possesses the cryptographic key, through the process of decryption.[179]
Authorization
Cryptography

Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental
disclosure while the information is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is
in storage.[71]
Cryptography provides information security with other useful applications as well, including improved
authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, non-repudiation, and encrypted network
communications.[180] Older, less secure applications such as Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are
slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as Secure Shell (SSH) that use encrypted
network communications.[181] Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as
WPA/WPA2 or the older (and less secure) WEP. Wired communications (such as ITU‑T G.hn) are
secured using AES for encryption and X.1035 for authentication and key exchange.[182] Software
applications such as GnuPG or PGP can be used to encrypt data files and email.[183]
Cryptography can introduce security problems when it is not implemented correctly.[184] Cryptographic
solutions need to be implemented using industry-accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer
review by independent experts in cryptography.[185] The length and strength of the encryption key is also
an important consideration.[186] A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption.[186] The
keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other
confidential information.[187] They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction, and
they must be available when needed. Public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions address many of the
problems that surround key management.[71]
U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines now make it possible to hold corporate officers liable for failing to
exercise due care and due diligence in the management of their information systems.[188]
In the field of information security, Harris[189] offers the following definitions of due care and due
diligence:
"Due care are steps that are taken to show that a company has taken responsibility for the
activities that take place within the corporation and has taken the necessary steps to help
protect the company, its resources, and employees[190]." And, [Due diligence are the]
"continual activities that make sure the protection mechanisms are continually maintained
and operational."[191]
Attention should be made to two important points in these definitions.[192][193] First, in due care, steps are
taken to show; this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible
artifacts.[194][195] Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities; this means that people are
actually doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are
ongoing.[196]
Organizations have a responsibility with practicing duty of care when applying information security. The
Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA)[197] provides principles and practices for evaluating
risk.[198] It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks.[199] DoCRA helps evaluate
Process

safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable
burden.[200] With increased data breach litigation, companies must balance security controls, compliance,
and its mission.[201]
Computer security incident management is a specialized form of incident management focused on
monitoring, detecting, and responding to security events on computers and networks in a predictable
way.[202]
Organizations implement this through incident response plans (IRPs) that are activated when security
breaches are detected.[203] These plans typically involve an incident response team (IRT) with specialized
skills in areas like penetration testing, computer forensics, and network security.[204]
Change management is a formal process for directing and controlling alterations to the information
processing environment.[205][206] This includes alterations to desktop computers, the network, servers,
and software.[207] The objectives of change management are to reduce the risks posed by changes to the
information processing environment and improve the stability and reliability of the processing
environment as changes are made.[208] It is not the objective of change management to prevent or hinder
necessary changes from being implemented.[209][210]
Any change to the information processing environment introduces an element of risk.[211] Even
apparently simple changes can have unexpected effects.[212] One of management's many responsibilities
is the management of risk.[213][214] Change management is a tool for managing the risks introduced by
changes to the information processing environment.[215] Part of the change management process ensures
that changes are not implemented at inopportune times when they may disrupt critical business processes
or interfere with other changes being implemented.[216]
Not every change needs to be managed.[217][218] Some kinds of changes are a part of the everyday routine
of information processing and adhere to a predefined procedure, which reduces the overall level of risk to
the processing environment.[219] Creating a new user account or deploying a new desktop computer are
examples of changes that do not generally require change management.[220] However, relocating user file
shares, or upgrading the Email server pose a much higher level of risk to the processing environment and
are not a normal everyday activity.[221] The critical first steps in change management are (a) defining
change (and communicating that definition) and (b) defining the scope of the change system.[222]
Change management is usually overseen by a change review board composed of representatives from key
business areas,[223] security, networking, systems administrators, database administration, application
developers, desktop support, and the help desk.[224] The tasks of the change review board can be
facilitated with the use of automated work flow application.[225] The responsibility of the change review
board is to ensure the organization's documented change management procedures are followed.[226] The
change management process is as follows[227]
Request: Anyone can request a change.[228][229] The person making the change request
may or may not be the same person that performs the analysis or implements the
change.[230][231] When a request for change is received, it may undergo a preliminary
Incident response plans
Change management

review to determine if the requested change is compatible with the organizations business
model and practices, and to determine the amount of resources needed to implement the
change.[232]
Approve: Management runs the business and controls the allocation of resources therefore,
management must approve requests for changes and assign a priority for every change.[233]
Management might choose to reject a change request if the change is not compatible with
the business model, industry standards or best practices.[234][235] Management might also
choose to reject a change request if the change requires more resources than can be
allocated for the change.[236]
Plan: Planning a change involves discovering the scope and impact of the proposed
change; analyzing the complexity of the change; allocation of resources and, developing,
testing, and documenting both implementation and back-out plans.[237] Need to define the
criteria on which a decision to back out will be made.[238]
Test: Every change must be tested in a safe test environment, which closely reflects the
actual production environment, before the change is applied to the production
environment.[239] The backout plan must also be tested.[240]
Schedule: Part of the change review board's responsibility is to assist in the scheduling of
changes by reviewing the proposed implementation date for potential conflicts with other
scheduled changes or critical business activities.[241]
Communicate: Once a change has been scheduled it must be communicated.[242] The
communication is to give others the opportunity to remind the change review board about
other changes or critical business activities that might have been overlooked when
scheduling the change.[243] The communication also serves to make the help desk and
users aware that a change is about to occur.[244] Another responsibility of the change review
board is to ensure that scheduled changes have been properly communicated to those who
will be affected by the change or otherwise have an interest in the change.[245][246]
Implement: At the appointed date and time, the changes must be implemented.[247][248]
Part of the planning process was to develop an implementation plan, testing plan and, a
back out plan.[249][250] If the implementation of the change should fail or, the post
implementation testing fails or, other "drop dead" criteria have been met, the back out plan
should be implemented.[251]
Document: All changes must be documented.[252][253] The documentation includes the
initial request for change, its approval, the priority assigned to it, the implementation,[254]
testing and back out plans, the results of the change review board critique, the date/time the
change was implemented,[255] who implemented it, and whether the change was
implemented successfully, failed or postponed.[256][257]
Post-change review: The change review board should hold a post-implementation review
of changes.[258] It is particularly important to review failed and backed out changes. The
review board should try to understand the problems that were encountered, and look for
areas for improvement.[258]
Change management procedures that are simple to follow and easy to use can greatly reduce the overall
risks created when changes are made to the information processing environment.[259] Good change
management procedures improve the overall quality and success of changes as they are implemented.[260]
This is accomplished through planning, peer review, documentation, and communication.[261]
ISO/IEC 20000, The Visible OPS Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps[262]
(Full book summary),[263] and ITIL all provide valuable guidance on implementing an efficient and
effective change management program information security.[264]

Business continuity management (BCM) concerns arrangements aiming to protect an organization's
critical business functions from interruption due to incidents, or at least minimize the effects.[265][266]
BCM is essential to any organization to keep technology and business in line with current threats to the
continuation of business as usual.[267] The BCM should be included in an organizations risk analysis plan
to ensure that all of the necessary business functions have what they need to keep going in the event of
any type of threat to any business function.[268]
It encompasses:
Analysis of requirements, e.g., identifying critical business functions, dependencies and
potential failure points, potential threats and hence incidents or risks of concern to the
organization;[269][270]
Specification, e.g., maximum tolerable outage periods; recovery point objectives (maximum
acceptable periods of data loss);[271]
Architecture and design, e.g., an appropriate combination of approaches including resilience
(e.g. engineering IT systems and processes for high availability,[272] avoiding or preventing
situations that might interrupt the business), incident and emergency management (e.g.,
evacuating premises, calling the emergency services, triage/situation[273] assessment and
invoking recovery plans), recovery (e.g., rebuilding) and contingency management (generic
capabilities to deal positively with whatever occurs using whatever resources are
available);[274]
Implementation, e.g., configuring and scheduling backups, data transfers, etc., duplicating
and strengthening critical elements; contracting with service and equipment suppliers;
Testing, e.g., business continuity exercises of various types, costs and assurance levels;[275]
Management, e.g., defining strategies, setting objectives and goals; planning and directing
the work; allocating funds, people and other resources; prioritization relative to other
activities; team building, leadership, control, motivation and coordination with other business
functions and activities[276] (e.g., IT, facilities, human resources, risk management,
information risk and security, operations); monitoring the situation, checking and updating
the arrangements when things change; maturing the approach through continuous
improvement, learning and appropriate investment;
Assurance, e.g., testing against specified requirements; measuring, analyzing, and reporting
key parameters; conducting additional tests, reviews and audits for greater confidence that
the arrangements will go to plan if invoked.[277]
Whereas BCM takes a broad approach to minimizing disaster-related risks by reducing both the
probability and the severity of incidents, a disaster recovery plan (DRP) focuses specifically on resuming
business operations as quickly as possible after a disaster.[278] A disaster recovery plan, invoked soon
after a disaster occurs, lays out the steps necessary to recover critical information and communications
technology (ICT) infrastructure.[279] Disaster recovery planning includes establishing a planning group,
performing risk assessment, establishing priorities, developing recovery strategies, preparing inventories
and documentation of the plan, developing verification criteria and procedure, and lastly implementing
the plan.[280]

Below is a partial listing of governmental laws and
regulations in various parts of the world that have, had, or
will have, a significant effect on data processing and
information security.[281][282] Important industry sector
regulations have also been included when they have a
significant impact on information security.[281]
The UK Data Protection Act 1998 makes new
provisions for the regulation of the processing of
information relating to individuals, including the
obtaining, holding, use or disclosure of such
information.[283][284] The European Union Data
Protection Directive (EUDPD) requires that all E.U. members adopt national regulations to
standardize the protection of data privacy for citizens throughout the E.U.[285][286]
The Computer Misuse Act 1990 is an Act of the U.K. Parliament making computer crime
(e.g., hacking) a criminal offense.[287] The act has become a model upon which several
other countries,[288] including Canada and Ireland, have drawn inspiration from when
subsequently drafting their own information security laws.[289][290]
The E.U.'s Data Retention Directive (annulled) required internet service providers and
phone companies to keep data on every electronic message sent and phone call made for
between six months and two years.[291]
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232 (https://www.la
w.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1232) g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a U.S. Federal law that protects
the privacy of student education records.[292] The law applies to all schools that receive
funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.[293] Generally,
schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student[293][294] in order to
release any information from a student's education record.[295]
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) security guidelines for
auditors specifies requirements for online banking security.[296]
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires the
adoption of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers
for providers, health insurance plans, and employers.[297] Additionally, it requires health care
providers, insurance providers and employers to safeguard the security and privacy of
health data.[298]
The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services
Modernization Act of 1999, protects the privacy and security of private financial information
that financial institutions collect, hold, and process.[299]
Section 404 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires publicly traded companies
to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls for financial reporting in annual reports
they submit at the end of each fiscal year.[300] Chief information officers are responsible for
the security, accuracy, and the reliability of the systems that manage and report the financial
data.[301] The act also requires publicly traded companies to engage with independent
auditors who must attest to, and report on, the validity of their assessments.[302]
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) establishes comprehensive
requirements for enhancing payment account data security.[303] It was developed by the
founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council — including American
Laws and regulations

Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide,[304] and Visa
International — to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures on
a global basis.[305] The PCI DSS is a multifaceted security standard that includes
requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software
design, and other critical protective measures.[306]
State security breach notification laws (California and many others) require businesses,
nonprofits, and state institutions to notify consumers when unencrypted "personal
information" may have been compromised, lost, or stolen.[307]
The Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA) of Canada
supports and promotes electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is
collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances,[308][309] by providing for the use of
electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending
the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision
Act.[310][311][312]
Greece's Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) (Law
165/2011) establishes and describes the minimum information security controls that should
be deployed by every company which provides electronic communication networks and/or
services in Greece in order to protect customers' confidentiality.[313] These include both
managerial and technical controls (e.g., log records should be stored for two years).[314]
Greece's Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) (Law
205/2013) concentrates around the protection of the integrity and availability of the services
and data offered by Greek telecommunication companies.[315] The law forces these and
other related companies to build, deploy, and test appropriate business continuity plans and
redundant infrastructures.[316]
The US Department of Defense (DoD) issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004, supplemented by DoD
Directive 8140, requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information
assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology (IT)
certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense
have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA). Andersson and
Reimers (2019) report these certifications range from CompTIA's A+ and Security+ through the
ICS2.org's CISSP, etc.[317]
Describing more than simply how security aware employees are, information security culture is the ideas,
customs, and social behaviors of an organization that impact information security in both positive and
negative ways.[318] Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or
work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. The way employees think
and feel about security and the actions they take can have a big impact on information security in
organizations. Roer & Petric (2017) identify seven core dimensions of information security culture in
organizations:[319]
Attitudes: employees' feelings and emotions about the various activities that pertain to the
organizational security of information.[320]
Behaviors: actual or intended activities and risk-taking actions of employees that have direct
or indirect impact on information security.
Cognition: employees' awareness, verifiable knowledge, and beliefs regarding practices,
activities, and self-efficacy relation that are related to information security.
Culture

Communication: ways employees communicate with each other, sense of belonging,
support for security issues, and incident reporting.
Compliance: adherence to organizational security policies, awareness of the existence of
such policies and the ability to recall the substance of such policies.
Norms: perceptions of security-related organizational conduct and practices that are
informally deemed either normal or deviant by employees and their peers, e.g. hidden
expectations regarding security behaviors and unwritten rules regarding uses of information-
communication technologies.
Responsibilities: employees' understanding of the roles and responsibilities they have as a
critical factor in sustaining or endangering the security of information, and thereby the
organization.
Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the
organization Information Security "effort" and often take actions that ignore organizational information
security best interests.[321] Research shows information security culture needs to be improved
continuously. In Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change, authors commented, "It's a never
ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance." To manage the information security
culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning,
implementation, and post-evaluation.[322]
Pre-evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to
analyze current security policy
Strategic planning: to come up a better awareness-program, we need to set clear targets.
Clustering people is helpful to achieve it
Operative planning: create a good security culture based on internal communication,
management buy-in, security awareness, and training programs
Implementation: should feature commitment of management, communication with
organizational members, courses for all organizational members, and commitment of the
employees[322]
Post-evaluation: to better gauge the effectiveness of the prior steps and build on continuous
improvement
