Computer security incident management
In the fields of computer security and information technology, computer security incident management
involves the monitoring and detection of security events on a computer or computer network, and the
execution of proper responses to those events. Computer security incident management is a specialized
form of incident management, the primary purpose of which is the development of a well understood and
predictable response to damaging events and computer intrusions.[1]
Incident management requires a process and a response team which follows this process. In the United
States, This definition of computer security incident management follows the standards and definitions
described in the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The incident coordinator manages the
response to an emergency security incident. In a Natural Disaster or other event requiring response from
Emergency services, the incident coordinator would act as a liaison to the emergency services incident
manager.[2]
An incident response plan (IRP) is a group of policies that dictate an organizations reaction to a cyber
attack. Once a security breach has been identified, for example by network intrusion detection system
(NIDS) or host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) (if configured to do so), the plan is initiated.[3] It
is important to note that there can be legal implications to a data breach. Knowing local and federal laws
is critical.[4] Every plan is unique to the needs of the organization, and it can involve skill sets that are not
part of an IT team.[5] For example, a lawyer may be included in the response plan to help navigate legal
implications to a data breach.
As mentioned above every plan is unique but most plans will include the following:[6]
Good preparation includes the development of an incident response team (IRT).[7] Skills need to be used
by this team would be, penetration testing, computer forensics, network security, etc.[8] This team should
also keep track of trends in cybersecurity and modern attack strategies.[9] A training program for end
users is important as well as most modern attack strategies target users on the network.[6]
As part of the preparation phase in incident response plan should be developed and address the following:
Roles and Responsibilities
Lists the incident response team (IRT) members and their duties
Communication protocols
Training and awareness
Logging policies and configurations
Event status definitions and thresholds
Playbooks and runbooks for common incident types
Incident response plans
Preparation

Legal and compliance considerations[10]
This part of the incident response plan identifies if there was a security event.[11] When an end user
reports information or an admin notices irregularities, an investigation is launched. An incident log is a
crucial part of this step. All of the members of the team should be updating this log to ensure that
information flows as fast as possible.[12] If it has been identified that a security breach has occurred the
next step should be activated.[13]
In this phase, the IRT works to isolate the areas that the breach took place to limit the scope of the
security event.[14] During this phase it is important to preserve information forensically so it can be
analyzed later in the process.[15] Containment could be as simple as physically containing a server room
or as complex as segmenting a network to not allow the spread of a virus.[16]
This is where the threat that was identified is removed from the affected systems.[17] This could include
deleting malicious files, terminating compromised accounts, or deleting other components.[18][19] Some
events do not require this step, however it is important to fully understand the event before moving to this
step.[20] This will help to ensure that the threat is completely removed.[16]
This stage is where the systems are restored back to original operation.[21] This stage could include the
recovery of data, changing user access information, or updating firewall rules or policies to prevent a
breach in the future.[22][23] Without executing this step, the system could still be vulnerable to future
security threats.[16]
In this step information that has been gathered during this process is used to make future decisions on
security.[24] This step is crucial to the ensure that future events are prevented. Using this information to
further train admins is critical to the process.[25] This step can also be used to process information that is
distributed from other entities who have experienced a security event.[26]
